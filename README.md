# LimeTr Wrapper for Forecast Team

## Dependence
To use the wrapper code you need to install the `linear_dev` branch of LimeTr.
* `git clone` the repository [here](https://github.com/zhengp0/limetr/tree/linear_dev).

* include path to repo at the beginning of the file `lme_forecast.py`.
  Currently it is the local path on my computer.

# LimeTr Wrapper for Forecast Team

To use the wrapper code you need to install the `linear_dev` branch of LimeTr.
* `git clone` the repository [here](https://github.com/zhengp0/limetr/tree/linear_dev).

* run `make clean` and `make special_mat` under the folder `limetr`

* include path to repo at the beginning of the file `lme_forecast_general.py`.
  Currently it is the local path on my computer.
